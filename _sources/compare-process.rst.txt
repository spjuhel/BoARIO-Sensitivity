Comparison process
====================

*How we aggregate results to have them comparable*

We run the simulation with each MRIOT typology. But in order to compare readable results we aggregate
to a select set of regions and sectors. The reasoning behind the aggregation as well as the mapping for each MRIOT
is presented in the supplementary materials.

Region aggregation
----------------------

We aggregate/select to ``DEU, FRA, CHN, USA`` and a rest of the world ``ROW`` region.

Sector aggregation
----------------------

We aggregate the  to 6 sectors, namely:

- Agriculture and Other
- Construction
- Energy and Utilities and Mining
- Manufacture
- Sales, Transports and Services
- Others
